1. check the inputs if have id's
        - see implementation of renderNewLink from components/editor/linkPage
2. based on ids get the values
3. create new object profileDetails to store this values
ex: keys for object looks like:
    firstName,
    lastName
    email
4. after all values are in object you need to store in localStorage
    - see implementation of saveItems from components/editor/linkPage
